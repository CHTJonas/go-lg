    Welcome to the Go-Looking Glass!
</p>

<p>
    Like other network looking glasses this system allows you to send ICMP pings
    or perform a traceroute to any host using IPv4 or IPv6. Unlike some other
    looking glasses it also produces reports with a unique URL that can be shared
    with your colleagues or friends. To get started, click a navigation link above.
